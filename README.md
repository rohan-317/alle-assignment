This repository contains code regarding Alle Assignment.

I have used Coil to load huge images into the app, as well as used all the clean architecture components like Jetpack Compose, ViewModel, LiveData, Coroutines, Koin for dependency and Accompanist for Permissions handling.

Min SDK version is 21, Target and Compile SDK version is 34.
